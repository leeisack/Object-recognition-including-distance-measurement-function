# Object-recognition-including-distance-measurement-function
Object recognition including distance measurement function without using ROS

---------------------
### I create a hexahedron by recognizing an object for embedded PC and outputting the minimum and maximum distance between the camera and the object. As a result, we are creating an object recognition system for stable autonomous driving of drones.
### Since the embedded PC installed on the drone is of low specification, the program should be made as light as possible, and for this reason, the gui has been removed as a result. But in the making process, I used the gui to check. I have committed both the version with and without the gui.
